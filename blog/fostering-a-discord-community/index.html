I enjoy bringing people together and
making a hub for people to chat. I&rsquo;ve moderated a few Discord servers before, and
even owned one myself with 500 members.</p><p>Even though in real life I am very introverted and not that social, in the online
world I kinda like talking to people (with similar interests of course) which is
why I enjoy managing servers, since staff members would be the ones with most
interaction with the community at large.</p><p>So my server with 500 members. I&rsquo;ve seen servers at ~4k members which weren&rsquo;t as active
as my previous server. That place basically never died, which made it hard to moderate
since I actually sleep and was basically the only staff. It was a good place, I still
have one of the members as a Discord friend (I should really talk to them again&mldr;).</p><p>What happened was kinda weird and I don&rsquo;t remember the details (or cared to) but
as the server expanded, it got more inactive, I opened staff applications and
interacted less. I don&rsquo;t really remember why I did this besides school, but I still
could&rsquo;ve been there after a school day was finished. But a part of the active members
of the server started to dislike me a bit, created their own server and separated
from the community. At that point I didn&rsquo;t really want to manage it anymore,
so I just passed ownership to someone who I gave an admin position.
That was a dumb decision since a couple days later the server was just gone.
Out of existence, deleted. Community that I put a sum of effort into pretty much
disappeared.</p><p>Me transferring ownership wasn&rsquo;t for the point of not wanting to associate with
that place anymore, I just didn&rsquo;t want the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; position anymore. I remember
sending a message to that admin as to why they deleted it but don&rsquo;t remember what they
said or any conversation. So of the members that created their server, the one I had
added as a friend gave an invite and I talked to the others.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s all I remember about that story of my server owner life. Lasted a couple
months. I always tried to make an active community after that with the same feel
as the original but it was never there, I couldn&rsquo;t even grow it to past 50 members.
Between that, I also had a separate server for announcing personal project news
and a side chat place (it was dead). At the start of 2021, I started being more active
on GitHub. I worked on my Stardew Valley mod manager, some Node.js packages and other
things. In between that, I decided to migrate my mini &ldquo;community&rdquo; and announcement
Discord to a newer different place, since I thought that making a new server and doing
a migration would be easier than changing around my old server. The intention would be
that the server would be a better community place to finally have a chat place decent chat
place. Unfortunately, It was yet again a dead place with once in a while messages. I didn&rsquo;t
really mind it that much though, since I was active in the r/unixporn Discord server.
In mid-March, I started development on Hilbish. My biggest project, and my longest living
one (more than 2 months!). Since it has semi-frequent version releases, I revamped
my server a bit and added specific news and software update ping roles.</p><p>I basically got burnt out around July and stopped making commits on Hilbish until the
middle of September. That was when I decided to make yet another revamp to my Discord
server to make it a bit better for a generalized community server. This server right now
is the <a href=https://discord.gg/3PDdcQz>cloud community</a>. With only 26 people while I&rsquo;m writing,
it&rsquo;s still a decently active community place even at that low member count.</p><p>I realized that to have a healthy or active community server, you don&rsquo;t need to have
20,000+ members. You just need a few frequently chatting people. I made a hoisted role
for active people, started saying more myself in there and put an advert in my Discord
bio. That&rsquo;s how I got the 26 members, from about 10.</p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=TorchedSammy/torchedsammy.github.io data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5MDQ1OTA=" data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOEK8BTs4CQrdA data-mapping=title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=transparent_dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div><script src=https://sammy.is-a.dev/js/index.min.33aaf61796ee8b1d3f9ff91b15a3a2b85ffafc7a8ff7480e8b5f87e39537252e.js integrity="sha256-M6r2F5buix0/n/kbFaOiuF/6/HqP90gOi1+H45U3JS4="></script><hr><small><div class=bar><div class=place-left><p>(c) TorchedSammy 2022</p></div><div class=place-center><i class='fas fa-heart'></i></div><div class=place-right><p>made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a> & <a href=https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura>sakura</a></p></div></div></small></body></html>
