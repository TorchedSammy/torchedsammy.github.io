There&rsquo;s times where I
just don&rsquo;t bother at all, but the way that I layout my things are pretty organized.
Despite this, I actually don&rsquo;t have a formal schedule for myself. I do have some
sort of routine of course, but I&rsquo;ll do things during the day at pretty much any time.</p><p>A friend of mine is very scheduled on their anime watching. An entire spreadsheet
for the year of what to watch, on what day and the episode. I don&rsquo;t think I can
reach to that level of proper scheduling. I definitely do want to make a schedule
of what I&rsquo;ll do during the week, that being working projects or idling on Discord,
or watching anime.</p><p>Speaking of schedules is sleep schedule. For the past few weeks, I have been going
to sleep at around 11:30pm or 12am and waking up at 7:45am. I do want to fix
this to get more sleep (maybe an hour earlier, 10pm) but it isn&rsquo;t an actual problem
for me right now. A method to sleep better is the 90 minute sleep cycle. For the time
that I want to wake up, track back 90 minutes each to the closest time that I intend
to go to bed. I saw this idea from a YouTube video and thought it would work <em>decently</em>
so I&rsquo;ll try it eventually.</p><p>Back to organization. I recently tagged a bunch of my music so that I can import into
cmus and for the sake of consistency. YouTube won&rsquo;t have any metadata tags, and
download websites vary. It takes effort to do these things but makes sure that everything
looks nice and of course organized.</p><p>In having a schedule, you&rsquo;re most likely gonna be an organized person and that is the
next step that I want to take.</p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=TorchedSammy/torchedsammy.github.io data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5MDQ1OTA=" data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOEK8BTs4CQrdA data-mapping=title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=transparent_dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div><script src=https://sammy.is-a.dev/js/index.min.33aaf61796ee8b1d3f9ff91b15a3a2b85ffafc7a8ff7480e8b5f87e39537252e.js integrity="sha256-M6r2F5buix0/n/kbFaOiuF/6/HqP90gOi1+H45U3JS4="></script><hr><small><div class=bar><div class=place-left><p>(c) TorchedSammy 2022</p></div><div class=place-center><i class='fas fa-heart'></i></div><div class=place-right><p>made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a> & <a href=https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura>sakura</a></p></div></div></small></body></html>
