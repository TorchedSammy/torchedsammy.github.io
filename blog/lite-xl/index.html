time I&rsquo;m working on a code project. Having a comfortable, extensible text editor
is important to me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been happily using Neovim for the past 1-2 years by now. Before that, while
on Windows, I was using Sublime Text around 3 years ago. Back then, I just
needed something to code in with some kind of autocomplete. I started using
Neovim a while after I moved to Linux and configured it in Vimscript with some
simple plugins and things like CoC. I kinda got hooked to programming with Lua
and using it for a lot of things (like <a href=https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish>Hilbish</a>)
and moved my Neovim config to Lua.</p><p>Pan to around February and I was suggested to try Lite XL. I&rsquo;ve already heard of Lite
(which Lite XL is a fork of) and tried both a year ago but at the time I thought
it was lacking for me to use it. But now I daily drive it as my main and only text
editor.</p><p>The title of this post mentions Lite XL being &ldquo;a dream close to reality,&rdquo; since
one of the reasons I used Neovim was that since there were no good GUI text editors
(except Sublime, but it also has some problems) but Lite XL is attractive for a few
reasons:</p><ul><li><em>Fast and Lightweight</em> GUI text editor</li><li>Lua scripted</li><li>Almost the entire editor is written in Lua itself, which makes it <em>very</em> extensible</li></ul><p>The first point could be argued against Sublime, but Lite XL is way lighter than it by
default. The C core is tiny, which means I can compile it in half a minute (!).
I also mentioned that it is very extensible. With only a couple lines of code,
I can put a clock at the corner of the screen. You can draw whatever on the
Lite XL window, which brings a lot of creativity. It&rsquo;s how I made this <a href=https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Visu>visualizer</a>
plugin.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also a few other plugins, including an <a href=https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-lsp/>LSP</a>.
If you need LSP kind icons by the way, <a href=https://github.com/TorchedSammy/lite-xl-lspkind>I have you covered.</a>
The title of this post once again mentions Lite XL being a dream <em>close to reality.</em>
There are/were a few problems I&rsquo;ve encountered. A first thing is <a href=https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/issues/838>graphical bugs</a>
due to my scaled screen. Another thing was that there was a few of plugins from
the central plugin repository broken. There were a few other minor things, but
close to all of these were fixed by using the master branch and using updated
plugins.</p><p>Lite XL is still fairly new and gets a lot of new additions, like the
status view no longer having hardcoded items and positions and instead has a
nice API to add, hide and move items. I&rsquo;ve also contributed a bit, whether that
is via discussion, the plugins and pull requests I&rsquo;ve made, like things to
improve syntax highlighting for Go and Markdown.</p><p>There&rsquo;s still quite a few things missing. A lot of the things I had in Neovim
I now don&rsquo;t have with Lite XL. Treesitter, which provided more advanced syntax
highlighting, <a href=https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>Telescope</a> and
Breadcrumbs (they&rsquo;re a bit helpful and add to the look). LSP plugin doesn&rsquo;t have
a few things like renaming and snippets but generally works well.</p><p>Would I recommend Lite XL? Yes, but it really depends on what you want/need.
As mentioned, the extensiblity, speed and lightness are the main selling points
but with a small ecosystem it just means if something quite general doesn&rsquo;t
exist, you&rsquo;ll have to make it yourself, and anything niche is off the table.
Atleast there&rsquo;s a <a href=https://github.com/eugenpt/lite-xl-vibe>Vim mode</a> plugin.</p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=TorchedSammy/torchedsammy.github.io data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5MDQ1OTA=" data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOEK8BTs4CQrdA data-mapping=title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=transparent_dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div><script src=https://sammy.is-a.dev/js/index.min.33aaf61796ee8b1d3f9ff91b15a3a2b85ffafc7a8ff7480e8b5f87e39537252e.js integrity="sha256-M6r2F5buix0/n/kbFaOiuF/6/HqP90gOi1+H45U3JS4="></script><hr><small><div class=bar><div class=place-left><p>(c) TorchedSammy 2022</p></div><div class=place-center><i class='fas fa-heart'></i></div><div class=place-right><p>made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a> & <a href=https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura>sakura</a></p></div></div></small></body></html>
