In the status
line there is a section between the git status and diff indicator and the percentage
of where I am in the buffer. I thought the space between the two looked a tiny bit
too much, so with my high intelligence I used a smaller unicode block character.
It solved my problem, except with Alacritty (the terminal I use) there was a tiny piece
sticking out from the line.</p><p><img src=https://modeus.is-inside.me/mVYLthyp.png alt></p><p>This is kinda irritating, just looking at that block sticking out there. Does Alacritty
focus so much on performance that it can&rsquo;t render this properly?
There&rsquo;s other cases where I&rsquo;ve seen it broken but I don&rsquo;t want to screenshot them all
and this was the easiest to get since it&rsquo;s always staring me in my face as much as I
have Neovim writing this blog.</p><blockquote><p>Why don&rsquo;t you just use another terminal?</p></blockquote><p>The thing is, I can&rsquo;t. Well I can, but they&rsquo;re all suboptimal in some form or the other.
My question to developers of these terminals: Is it hard to make an <em>efficient</em>
terminal? Alacritty works well, except for my font issue.</p><p>What about kitty? It&rsquo;s also GPU accelerated, and also uses ~100mb of RAM per instance.
I have to open 12 or 13 Alacritty instances for it to take that same amount.
<a href=https://github.com/wez/wezterm>WezTerm</a> is also a GPU accelerated terminal,
quite a recent one too. It has the same problem as kitty with the RAM usage.
My device is a laptop with 4GB of ram, which is mostly used already, so having a memory
efficient terminal is actually important to me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried some other random terminals I found on GitHub like <a href=https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour>contour</a>
or <a href=https://github.com/liamg/darktile>darktile</a> but those specifically are so slow in Neovim
(or in my shell in the case of contour) that they&rsquo;re not an option at all.</p><p>Urxvt is a decent terminal but it isn&rsquo;t GPU accelerated and in some cases for input
is actually a bit slow (it&rsquo;s worked fine for me though) so I can literally see it scanning
over the entire window when I open a new file in Neovim. Atleast I can set fallback fonts
(looking at you Alacritty).</p><p>I really think at this point terminals on Windows may be better. Unless another terminal
comes around and has Alacritty&rsquo;s performance with how WezTerm/kitty handle fonts
and fallbacks, I may have to continue using Alacritty or deal with WezTerm&rsquo;s RAM usage.</p><p>And no, I&rsquo;m not using st.</p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=TorchedSammy/torchedsammy.github.io data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5MDQ1OTA=" data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOEK8BTs4CQrdA data-mapping=title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=transparent_dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div><script src=https://sammy.is-a.dev/js/index.min.25bc1a51c849f067b5e2cd37c1ca428e9687dd3406410e30c5a2af0a02c535d7.js integrity="sha256-JbwaUchJ8Ge14s03wcpCjpaH3TQGQQ4wxaKvCgLFNdc="></script><hr><small><div class=bar><div class=place-left><p>(c) TorchedSammy 2022</p></div><div class=place-center><i class='fas fa-heart'></i></div><div class=place-right><p>made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a> & <a href=https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura>sakura</a></p></div></div></small></body></html>
