I have it in the background while working on a project, I jam to it while bored
or just have it playing so my environment won&rsquo;t be completely silent. Except when

Now, I don&rsquo;t feel like paying for Spotify premium <em>just</em> to not have ads,
so I stopped using it!</p><p><img src=https://modeus.is-inside.me/TREhttCz.png alt="A small view of my local music library.">
For music that I like (which is mostly what I listen to) I downloaded and properly
tagged all of them (some manually). The perks of this is no ads (obviously) and
offline listening. I can also sync this between my phone easily, as my music is just
on my Google Drive. As I&rsquo;m not an audiophile and don&rsquo;t want music taking <em>that much</em>
storage, I have them in 124kbps MP3 or M4A.</p><p>A con to this is having to host all of this. Going my route with the quality
and format, it&rsquo;ll take a LOT of music to reach Google Drive&rsquo;s free tier of 15GB
storage.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always downloaded my favourites, which is mostly kpop but I decided to take
a pretty much full time switch away from Spotify. A question you may ask is about music
discovery. If you only have a local library, how do you find new music to listen to?
To answer that question, YouTube and osu are the ways of how I get new music.</p><p>YouTube is definitely a great place to get a very wide variety of music, as there is
independent artists, meme songs and whatever that aren&rsquo;t on services like Spotify.
A good example is <em>Maid with Dragons,</em> the season 2 opening song of <em>Miss Kobayashi&rsquo;s
Dragon Maid.</em> Of course, I can download this from YouTube instead with youtube-dl.
The reason I also mentioned osu is that because it&rsquo;s a rhythm game, and I find a lot
of random but good maps (and therefore songs) and I can definitely say that
it has helped in finding a lot of good music. This is how I discovered Ashnikko,
currently a personal favourite with her type of music.</p><p>If you only really listen to music once in a while, and/or just the stuff you like,
I recommend going the local approach or using YouTube, and if you need a rich presence
kinda like Spotify&rsquo;s, <a href=https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Clematis>Clematis</a> has you
