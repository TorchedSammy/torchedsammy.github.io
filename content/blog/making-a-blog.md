Hello, sammy here. A blog!  
I decided to make a blog so I can put some of my random thoughts or do
a write up on something. Why? Why not?

It'll probably be boring and kinda inactive but whatever.

If you couldn't notice, it's made with Hugo since I thought that would be the
easiest to setup. I previously had my thoughts up [over here](https://tilde.town/~sammyette/thoughts/)
on tilde.town but this is easier to theme in my opinion.

So, welcome to my dumb blog!! Hope you enjoy my ramblings on things I don't know about
and rants.
