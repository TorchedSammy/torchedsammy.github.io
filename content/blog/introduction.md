I feel like I should make a more general introduction post to tell more info
about myself. Hello!

I'm sammyette, if you couldn't tell. Some people just call me sammy since it's easier,
or TorchedSammy as that's my username in some places (kinda want to change though).
I write code. It's not good code at all, but it works and lately that is all
that I care about.

Besides programming dumb things, I also watch TV shows like dramas and anime.
I have [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/TorchedSammy) and
[MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/profile/torchedsammy) profiles linked.
As of now, I've been watching *What's Wrong with Secretary Kim* and it's a
romantic comedy show which is a little bit dumb in a fun way.
I haven't watched an anime in a while, and the last that I was looking at
was *Ghost Stories* of all things primarily for the "so bad that it's good"
English dub.

In any other free time I have when I'm not watching shows, I play some games.
These include Stardew Valley (which I plan to write about soon), Minecraft,
Teeworlds and anything that I have. I haven't been enjoying playing these in
single player lately (also will write about).

If you can't tell, I don't write a lot in these. Honestly, a short blog is easier
to read and for me to write but when I have something that I definitely want to
rant about or enthusiastic about then it won't be a minute read, so stay tuned
for that!
