Another blog post about my mental health! Awesome.  
I've been at home on summer holiday for basically 2 months now. While I
definitely do enjoy alone time doing whatever I want, at some point I do
want to talk to people. To fill this void of communication, I regularly
chat in Discord but a LOT of the times it is about trivial and dumb things
and I really wish I could have regular conversations about something
productive rather than "which distro is better" which is a *regular*
topic in the r/unixporn Discord server.

To occupy my time besides that, I have been playing retro games recently.
This includes the SNES classics like Yoshi's Island or PS1 stuff like Gran
Turismo. The thing is I get bored VERY quickly playing single player games
and there is literally no one I know with the same interests.

Friends? They're just people you know. The only mutual interest shared with
my small circle of them is anime, which is not really a good daily topic
of talk (in my opinion).

So with me not being fulfilled with any of that, I am left with programming
and watching YouTube videos, but there is only so much YouTube I can watch
before I get bored with *that* and programming is the same thing where I
constantly have 0 motivation to do anything.

I have a lot of mood swings, and a high percent of the time, the negative
ones are more than the positive ones.
