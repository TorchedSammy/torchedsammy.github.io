Hello! I have not written a blog post in a while (around 3 months)
and I am glad to announce that this is basically a life update
or piece about mental health that will be positive!

## Firstly, some backstory?
About a year or 2 ago, I wrote [this post here](../happiness)
that isn't exactly positive because life was not exactly positive.
It was kinda boring even though there was some things I enjoyed doing
once in a while, but the current year is 2023 and some things
have changed.

Some of you may know me and the fact that I am a lonely guy
(or was - will talk about soon) that makes things and plays games,
and also does that on probably world's worst laptop. Both of those things
have changed or will change!!

## New Laptop
I have not actually gotten the new laptop yet. I am writing this post on
the ancient "chairtop" still (will make a mini post for my beloved laptop
soon), but in a week or two I will have gone through the greatest upgrade of
all time.

The new laptop in question is an [Acer Aspire Vero](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B09R63Z5L7/ref=ox_sc_act_image_3?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)
that has a good CPU, nice amount of RAM, and is at a good price because
a man's poor and needs a good but cheap laptop, though I will also be getting
a 2TB SSD with it to store all the new games I'll be able to play like
Final Fantasy XIV Online!! (I shall write about this soon as well).

## Socializing and Relationships
The most important part in this post.

Ever since a few months ago, at a certain sporting event, I have met
and talked to quite a range of people. Friends, yay !! Always good
to make new friends. I was actually talking to people outside of my
classmates and school, though these are school friends, just not in
the same school.

An important thing to mention is that these new friends were girls,
and I was fine with keeping things friendly because friends are
cool but there was one who I really liked and talked to almost daily.
At the beginning of the year, after a failed attempt, I was basically
content with just chilling by myself and enjoying some good gaming
and media watching, but an event will happen that would turn some of
that alone time into hangouts with a special someone and gaming *with*
that someone.

### Friendgirl??
Now, I am terrible with hints. I have seen Reddit posts and YouTube videos
about *other guys* being terrible with hints. They are not quite obvious.
So you know the person I just mentioned about talking to daily and liking a lot?
It turns out the feelings were mutual but I did not realize until she was
*almost* telling me to tell her to be my girlfriend. I had to (quote exactly)
decode the signal, and it turns out my decoder program compiled at first try
and worked correctly.

So I have one of those now. A girlfriend. Literally nobody will believe
but yes, real person, real events. I am not delusional (yet) so
I don't need to take schizo pills for her to disappear, and with all that
happening, I am glad to announce that happiness has been found.
That was a good reference to the title of the blog, wasn't it?

There was some circumstances that could have made everything not happen at all,
but now I have a loving person who will play Minecraft with me and will do
some pair programming with me ~~(and hand holding)~~. I think.
