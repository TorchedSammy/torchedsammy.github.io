Good entertainment for me is thrilling (melo)drama. I mentioned in one of my previous
posts that I've been watching *What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?* and it's a romance
drama. I still haven't finished watching it yet, because I've been writing posts
for this blog and playing retro games.

A show that I have been keeping up with is
[*The Second Husband*](https://mydramalist.com/698835-second-husband). It's episode
length is 30mins so it's easier to digest but has 120 episodes total. *Second Husband*
is an interesting story since it is a revenge drama that has romance in it. The series
starts off a bit slow, but progressively gets addicting and wondering what will happen
in the next episode.

My first drama was [*Mother*](https://mydramalist.com/21308-mother) which is also a very
interesting story about child abuse and what it really means to be a mother. Anytime
someone asks for drama recommendations, I always say this first since it hit me so
differently compared to others I've watched.

I've also watched the adaptation of *True Beauty* and even while I've read the source
manhwa I still enjoyed it like I didn't know anything about it.

Honestly I just wanted to shill *Second Husband* as it's a drama that I am currently
enjoying **a lot** and I'm always impatient waiting for the weekend to watch the latest
5 episodes.
