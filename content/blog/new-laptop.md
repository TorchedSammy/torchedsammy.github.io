Welcome to another blog post, the first one on my cool new laptop.
I am now rocking an Acer Aspire Vero with an 11th Gen Intel i7-1195G7
and 16 whole gigs of RAM!

My old laptop can probably hold a record for worst laptop that exists
due to how terrible it is, though I managed to still be productive on
it and also play games. So let's talk about it before we go towards the
new one.

My old laptop is an HP trashtop made around 2013-2014. It worked fine when I
got it and ran Windows 8, but as it aged and the year turned to 2023,
I had Linux on it because Windows liked to not boot sometimes and Windows 10
barely ran on it anyway.

That thing features an AMD E1-2100 which clocks in at a whole 1GHz.
That is 1 single gigahert to do some very awesome computing. It was
enough to handle my semi-regular 70 tabs (even though it died once in a while)
and gaming for the games I played.

You can already imagine why I needed a new laptop because the specs of the
old one are absolutely trash. But actually, I also needed a laptop that can
function *like a laptop.* You may be wondering what that means, but my old laptop
is immobile. Both hinges on it are broken and the 2 halves are connected by a single
wire for the screen. It also has no working battery.

I went to searching for a good laptop that was also cheap enough and
I found the [Acer Aspire Vero](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B09R63Z5L7/ref=ox_sc_act_image_3?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1).
When I got it, the price was at $500 dollars, which is WAY better value
than any local offerings of laptops. So I had to wait 2+ weeks for it to ship
to my island country and be imported. I can definitely say the wait was worth it.

With this thing, I can do many things, like using Windows! Wow!
The important parts were the ability to play more games and to have
a portable laptop for school.

Speaking of games, what games can I play with this thing now?
Well, I used to play Apex Legends on PS4 so now I can finally play that.
Warframe as well. My old Lutris library only consisted of things that could run
on my old laptop, so when I transferred it to my new laptop, everything ran
at a nice locked 60 fps. Need for Speed Most Wanted did not have any frame
drops at all with max settings. :)

I can also play Minecraft, with mods, at more than 40 fps.
The Simply Optimized modpack did pretty good on my old laptop,
but I can run more mods and quality of life stuff at almost 3x that framerate,
and I can use *shaders* at 40-50 fps, which is pretty good!! 

Another thing is not having to close Discord and Chrome whenever I play
a game. Gotta close them to save some extra resources and frames, but not
anymore!! I am never going to see the framerate counter while playing osu! again,
because it'll be locked at 120.

The backlight on the keyboard is also very nice. I can start typing
properly if I can see what keys to press. This means I don't need to use
the screen light to look at the keys or my phone flashlight.

The new laptop also features 2TB of storage that I upgraded myself. This ensures
that I can install more than 2 whole games! I love modern games.

I can definitely say that I am enjoying my laptop, and have been for the past
2 months that I have had it. I was worried about the battery being ruined if
I left it on charge all day, but new battery tech is kinda smart, so that's
not too much of a worry. I'll find out fully in a year though, and easily
user removable batteries like the years before would still be better.
