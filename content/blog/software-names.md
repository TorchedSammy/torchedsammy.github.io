Naming things is hard, especially new projects and software.
I like flowers. They're pretty and nice so if I'm lazy, I just name a new piece
of my software based on a flower that I like. But I don't just pick any flower.
I gotta have a unique sounding name and I also can't just name the repo
"NightSkyPetunia" so I'm limited to a short single word name.

Other times I do actually take effort in thinking of a name based on what it is about,
or thing of a random name and just theme the project based on it. The latter
is easier to do in my opinion. Like for [Ceta](https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Ceta)
which is short for Cetacean and a working logo could just be a whale.
[Econode](https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Econode) is one of those projects with a
name that has effort put into it, and kinda says what it's about.

A nice name for your project can bring some kind of interest or a nice logo.
I would say that I am good at naming things. Some people also say that I am.
