This is an update to my previous blog post, so hopefully the title
makes sense. Hello everyone! A few things have happened since I made that post in May,
including being a single person again, so maybe I'll talk about that
immediately.

I'm not really gonna go into too much detail, but things happened
and I woke up to a break up text. That was a great surprise for the rest
of the day, and I didn't care that much about it actually. To me it was just
"well that happened, quite unfortunate." I have more time to myself? Great???
So I'll say that I actually don't mind being a single guy now. I've also
found some more time watching TV shows and using my self hosted Jellyfin
and other media servers that I'll eventually talk about on my blog (TLDR: 
wooooooo freee media)

My laptop is still going great, but I've been having a few *small* problems with it.
Firstly, screen retention is a bit common if I'm using full brightness and it's
very annoying. It's OLED burn in but on an LCD, goes away eventually, and happens
a lot more.

A second issue I used to have was sleep on Linux causing the fans to not work after
it wakes up, but that doesn't seem to happen anymore. The last thing is that a part
of the shell broke somehow, but that was just my fault.

So my only real complaint is the screen retention. I leave my screen on my torrent
client for slightly too long at full brightness and the image is now stuck for a few
minutes on the screen. It still doesn't quite run *everything* I want to play,
but it does 95% of games, can handle tons of apps and 400 chrome tabs open.
