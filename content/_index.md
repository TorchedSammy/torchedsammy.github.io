# Info

Hello there! My name is sammy. I'm an avid gamer and semi sarcastic programmer.
I have been doing this for 5 years. Doesn't mean it's good, but that fact is there.
In my programming life I've used Node.js, Python and Rust,
but I currently tinker with Go and Lua for some of my projects.

# Projects
These are just a small portion of my best/active projects.
To see all, go to the [dedicated page](projects).

[Hilbish](https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish) - ðŸŒº The flower shell. A comfy and nice little shell for Lua users and fans!  
[Aster](https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Aster) - Command line image colorizer utility.
