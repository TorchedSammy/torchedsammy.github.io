<h1><a href='https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/'>Hilbish</a></h1>

ðŸŒº The flower shell. A comfy and nice little shell for Lua users and fans!  
Hilbish is a Unix-y shell made for people who prefer Lua over shell script.
It is scripted and configured in Lua and is highly customizable and extensible.

<h1><a href='https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Aster'>Aster</a></h1>

Command line image colorizer utility.  
Aster takes an image and recolors it based on a provided palette.
It can do it with dithering, which makes the result look nicer instead
of doing a plain match to closest color of a pixel in the palette.
